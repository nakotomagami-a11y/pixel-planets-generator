/**
 * Spherical shading overlay.
 *
 * A generic depth pass composited LAST over solid-sphere planet types. It
 * reconstructs the sphere normal from screen UV, lights it from `light_origin`,
 * and paints a dark, posterized terminator crescent on the unlit hemisphere
 * plus limb darkening at the grazing edge. This is what makes a planet read as
 * a lit 3D ball instead of a flat textured disc — the surface shaders only
 * band the palette colours, which is often too subtle to sell the sphere.
 *
 * Output is a near-black straight-alpha overlay (RGB≈0, alpha ramps up in
 * shadow), so SRC_ALPHA blending simply darkens whatever surface is beneath —
 * palette-independent. Alpha is stepped into a few bands so the terminator has
 * the chunky pixel-art edge of the rest of the set rather than a smooth gradient.
 *
 * Disc-clipped and canvasScale-aware (uv_offset/uv_scale) so it lines up with
 * the shrunk body on 2× types (gas-giant, ringed-terran).
